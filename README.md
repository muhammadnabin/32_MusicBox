## üìñ Overview
This project transforms an **ESP32 development board** into a **Bluetooth speaker** by using the **A2DP sink profile**.  
The ESP32 receives audio from a phone, laptop, or other Bluetooth audio source and sends it to a **MAX98357 I2S digital audio amplifier**, which drives a speaker.

This setup allows you to stream music directly from **YouTube, Spotify, or local media players** over Bluetooth to your custom DIY speaker.

## üîå Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 Development Board (e.g., DevKit V1, WROOM)
- MAX98357A I2S Audio Amplifier Module
- 4‚Äì8 Œ© Speaker (3W or greater recommended)
- USB cable or regulated 5 V power supply
- Jumper wires and breadboard (for prototyping)

## ü™õ Wiring

| MAX98357 Pin | ESP32 Pin |
|--------------|-----------|
| **LRC / WS** | GPIO **26** |
| **BCLK**     | GPIO **27** |
| **DIN**      | GPIO **25** |
| **VIN**      | 5V (recommended for best audio output) |
| **GND**      | GND |
| **SD**       | leave floating or tie to 3.3V (ON) |
| **GAIN**     | Floating = 15 dB, GND = 9 dB, 3.3V = 18 dB |

üîä **Speaker Connection:** connect the speaker across `OUT+` and `OUT-` (do **not** connect to GND).

## üì¶ Required Libraries
Install these libraries in Arduino IDE via **Library Manager**:
- [AudioTools](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools) (for I2S management)
- [ESP32-A2DP](https://github.com/pschatzmann/ESP32-A2DP) (for Bluetooth A2DP sink)

Also, ensure you have the latest **ESP32 board support package** (version `2.0.x` or later).

## üîä Usage Instructions
1. Wire the ESP32 and MAX98357 as described above.  
2. Flash the sketch from this repository to your ESP32.  
3. Power the ESP32 with USB or an external **5 V supply**.  
4. On your phone/PC, scan for Bluetooth devices ‚Üí select **`32_MusicBox By Nabin`**.  
5. Play audio from YouTube, Spotify, or any media app ‚Üí sound will output from the speaker.

## ‚ö° Tips for Better Sound
- Use a **solid 5 V power supply** (‚â• 1 A). Running on 3.3 V reduces output power.  
- Tie **GAIN ‚Üí 3.3 V** for the loudest setting (~18 dB).  
- Use a **4 Œ© speaker** for maximum volume (compared to 8 Œ©).  
- Place your speaker in a **small enclosure or box** to improve volume and bass response.  
- Check **phone Bluetooth settings**: disable *Absolute Volume* in Android developer options if volume is capped.

## üí° Future Improvements
- Add **OLED display** for track/connection status.  
- Add **buttons/IR remote** for play/pause/skip.  
- Add **battery power management** for portable use.  
- Integrate **EQ/DSP features** with AudioTools library.
